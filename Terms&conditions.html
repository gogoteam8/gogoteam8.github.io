        <p><br />
            The following booking conditions form the basis of your contract
            with Adventure Alternative Ltd ("we", "us" and "our").
            Please read them carefully as they set out our respective rights and obligations. By asking us to confirm your booking,
            we are entitled to assume that you have had the opportunity
            to read and have read these booking conditions and agree to them.
        </p>
        <p>
            These booking conditions only apply to the trip arrangements which you book with us in the UK and which we agree to make,
            provide or perform (as applicable) as part of our contract with you.
            All references in these booking conditions to "trip", "booking", "contract" or "arrangements" mean such trip arrangements unless otherwise stated.
            References to "departure" mean the start date of these arrangements.

        <div class="box"><h3>Moving Mountains fundraising commitment </h3></div>
        <p><br />
            Please note that if your arrangements relate to a
            fundraising trip on behalf of the<b>Moving Mountains charity </b>then it is a condition of your participation
            that you meet the fundraising target set by Moving Mountains.
            If you have failed to meet the fundraising target  by four weeks before departure you will be liable to pay any
            shortfall between the amount you have raised and the target set. If you are unable or unwilling
            to pay any shortfall then we will be entitled to treat your booking as cancelled by you. In such circumstances
            the cancellation charges set out in paragraph 7 will apply.
            If we do not cancel straight away
            because you have promised to make payment or raise additional sums,
            the charges set out in clause 7 will apply on the date we then reasonably treat your booking as cancelled.

        <div class="box"><h3>Booking your trip and payment details </h3></div>
        <p><br />
            <b>1.To make a booking</b> please follow the procedure shown on our website or ask for an offline application form.
            The relevant application form needs to be completed by each person travelling.
            Where you are under 18 at the time of booking,
            the application form also needs to be signed by your parent or guardian or initialled online during the booking process.
            The completed booking form must then be sent to us together with the payments referred to in paragraph 2 below.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where we have already confirmed the availability of your chosen arrangements and you book within any applicable time limit for doing so,
            your booking will be treated as firm and a contract between us will come into existence as soon as we receive your completed application
            form and your deposit. We will then send you a receipt for all payments made and our invoice. Where we have not confirmed availability,
            your booking will be treated as firm and a contract between us will come into existence when we despatch our invoice to you.
            Where you book through our website without prior confirmation of availability,
            any electronic acknowledgement of your booking is not a confirmation of it. Please check your invoice carefully as soon as you receive it.
            Contact us immediately if any information which appears on the invoice or any other document appears to be incorrect or incomplete.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            <b> 2.A minimum deposit</b> of Â£100.00 sterling per person must accompany the booking.
            We also offer and encourage an instalment plan with 50% of the trip payment made by a minimum of 3 months prior to departure.
            In any case the full balance must be received by us by six weeks prior to departure.
            Bookings made within six weeks require immediate full payment.
        </p>
        <p>
            If, for any reason, the balance (including any surcharge where applicable) is not received by the due date, we reserve the right to treat the booking as cancelled by you.
            If we do not cancel straight away because you have promised to make payment,
            you must pay the cancellation charges shown in paragraph 7 depending on the date we reasonably treat your booking as cancelled.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            <b>3. The price quoted</b>for any trip covers the cost of the planning,
            the organisation and carrying out of the trip, including group equipment, supplies, accommodation,
            administration and staff, except for the following, for which the you must be responsible:
            vaccination fees, travel insurance, cost of travel to and from the start / return point of your trip
            including your international flights, cost of passport and visas,
            personal equipment and personal expenses while on the trip and any other expenses specifically excluded on the trip description and/or invoice.
        </p>

        <p>
            We reserve the right to make changes to and correct errors in quoted prices at any time before your trip is confirmed.
            We will advise you of any error of which we are aware and of the then applicable price at the time of booking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the price of your chosen trip has been confirmed at the time of booking, then subject to the correction of errors, we will only increase or decrease the price in the event of any change in our transportation costs or in dues,
            taxes or fees or in the exchange rates which have been used to calculate the cost of your trip.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            <b>4.A surcharge or refund </b>(as applicable) will be payable, subject to the conditions set out in this clause. Even in the above cases, only if the amount of any increase in our costs exceeds 2% of the total cost of your trip will we levy a surcharge. If any surcharge is greater than 10% of the cost of your trip,
            you will be entitled to cancel your booking and receive
            a full refund of all monies you have paid to us or alternatively purchase another trip from us as referred to in paragraph 12.
        </p>
        <p>
            Where applicable, you have 14 days from the issue date printed on the surcharge invoice to tell us if you want to choose option (2) or (3) as set out in paragraph 12 below. If you do not tell us that you wish to choose either of these options within this period of time, we are entitled to assume
            that you do not wish to do so and will pay the surcharge. Any surcharge must be paid with the balance of the cost of the trip or within 14 days of the issue date printed on the surcharge invoice,
            whichever is the later. A refund will only be payable if the decrease in our costs exceeds 2% of the total cost of your trip as set out above. Where a refund is due, we will pay you the full amount of the decrease in our costs.
            We promise not to levy a surcharge within 30 days of departure and no refund will be payable during this period either.
        </p><br />
        <p>
            <b>5. Travel insurance:</b>It is essential that you have adequate and appropriate cover for your trip including any adventurous activities such as trekking at altitude. Note that the majority of our trips do not require the use of climbing ropes and are all supervised.
            It is important to have adequate insurance which will cover cancellation costs from the date of booking as well as medical expenses (including evacuation and repatriation). If you travel against FCO advice, the validity of your insurance policy may be affected. Please read your policy details carefully and take them with you on your trip. It is your responsibility to ensure that the insurance cover you purchase is suitable and adequate for your particular needs.
